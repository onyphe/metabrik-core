Metabrik
========

   The Metabrik Platform bind togother a classic Shell with a Perl interpreter as
   a REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) and a ton of small  Briks.  Briks  are  reusable
   components each performing a specific task. You  chain  Briks  together  using
   Perl variables, they are used to pass output of a Brik Command  as  input  for
   another Brik Command.

   By chaining Briks togother, you easily create new powerful  tools,  just  like
   the UNIX pipe.

   Briks also share the same syntax so you don't have to scratch your  head  each
   time you use yet-another-tool, and they also feature integrated help.
